This project is our entry for the Uphoria Hackathon organised by Udaigiri. Our project basically serves as a 'Movie Search Engine'. 
We type in the name of a film in the search box on our application page, and select one particular result. On selecting the movie, we are displayed all the information about the movie- such as the title, release date, language, and so on and so forth.
